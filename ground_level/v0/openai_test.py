steps:
cd into 'ragtag'

create python virtual env:
`python -m venv openai-env`

Once youâ€™ve created the virtual environment, you need to activate it. 
On Windows, run:
`openai-env/Scripts/activate`

On Unix or MacOS, run:
`source openai-env/bin/activate`

Install the OpenAI Python library (i got an error and needed to run vscode as administrator to fix)
`pip install --upgrade openai`

good to go
